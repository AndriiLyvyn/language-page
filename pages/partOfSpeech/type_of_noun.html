            <h1>The Saxon Genitive in English</h1>
    
            <p>The Saxon Genitive (also known as the possessive case) is used in English to indicate possession or relationships. It is formed by adding an apostrophe and the letter 's' ('s) to a noun.</p>
            
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>John's book</strong> - The book that belongs to John</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h2>Rules of Usage</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Adding 's</h3>
            <p>For most nouns, add <strong>'s</strong> to form the Saxon Genitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tom's hat</strong> - Tom's hat</li>
                <li><strong>The cat's toy</strong> - The cat's toy</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>2. Plural Nouns Ending in s</h3>
            <p>For plural nouns that end in <strong>s</strong>, add only an apostrophe (') without the additional <strong>s</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The teachers' lounge</strong> - The lounge of the teachers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Irregular Plural Nouns</h3>
            <p>For irregular plural nouns that do not end in <strong>s</strong>, add <strong>'s</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The children's books</strong> - The books belonging to the children</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Proper Nouns</h3>
            <p>Proper nouns can also use the Saxon Genitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>James's house</strong> - The house of James</li>
                <li><strong>Alice's book</strong> - The book of Alice</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Time Expressions</h3>
            <p>The Saxon Genitive can be used to express time.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A day's work</strong> - Work for one day</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>The Saxon Genitive is most commonly used for people and animals. For inanimate objects or abstract ideas, English sometimes prefers the use of "of" instead of the Saxon Genitive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The cover of the book</strong> - Instead of <strong>The book's cover</strong></li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

            <p>In English, nouns are categorized into countable and uncountable nouns. Understanding the difference between these two types of nouns is essential for proper grammar usage.</p>
            
            <h2>Countable Nouns</h2>
            <p>Countable nouns are those that can be counted. They have both singular and plural forms.</p>
            
            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Book</strong> - <em>Books</em></li>

            <h2>Uncountable Nouns</h2>
            <p>Uncountable nouns cannot be counted and do not have a plural form. They refer to substances, concepts, or collective categories.</p>

                <h1>Compound Nouns in English</h1>
    
                <p>Compound nouns are nouns made up of two or more words that together form a single noun with a specific meaning. These components can be combined in various ways to create new meanings.</p>
                
                <h2>Types of Compound Nouns</h2>
                
                <h3>1. Noun + Noun</h3>
                <p>When two nouns are combined, the first noun often acts as a modifier to describe the second noun.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Toothbrush</strong> - A brush for cleaning teeth</li>
                    <li><strong>Airport</strong> - A port for airplanes</li>
                    <li><strong>Snowman</strong> - A man made of snow</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>2. Adjective + Noun</h3>
                <p>When an adjective and a noun are combined, the adjective describes the noun.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Highway</strong> - A main road that is high in importance</li>
                    <li><strong>Blackboard</strong> - A board that is black in color</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>3. Verb + Noun</h3>
                <p>When a verb and a noun are combined, the verb describes the action related to the noun.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Swimming pool</strong> - A pool used for swimming</li>
                    <li><strong>Driving license</strong> - A license for driving</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>4. Preposition + Noun</h3>
                <p>When a preposition and a noun are combined, the preposition modifies the noun.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Underwear</strong> - Clothing worn under other clothes</li>
                    <li><strong>Backyard</strong> - The yard at the back of a house</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Formation and Usage</h2>
                
                <p>Compound nouns can be written in three different ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Closed form:</strong> The words are written as one single word (e.g., <strong>notebook</strong>, <strong>sunflower</strong>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyphenated form:</strong> The words are connected by hyphens (e.g., <strong>mother-in-law</strong>, <strong>well-being</strong>).</li>
                    <li><strong>Open form:</strong> The words are written separately (e.g., <strong>coffee table</strong>, <strong>swimming pool</strong>).</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Examples in Sentences</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Closed form:</strong> <em>She bought a new <strong>toothbrush</strong>.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Hyphenated form:</strong> <em>He visited his <strong>mother-in-law</strong> yesterday.</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Open form:</strong> <em>We spent the afternoon at the <strong>swimming pool</strong>.</em></li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Compound nouns are versatile and help convey specific meanings by combining words. They can be formed in closed, hyphenated, or open forms, and they often involve various combinations of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and prepositions.</p>

                  <h1>Quantifiers in English</h1>
    
    <p>Quantifiers are words used to express quantity or amount. They help to provide information about how much or how many of something there is. Quantifiers can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns.</p>
    
    <h2>Quantifiers for Countable Nouns</h2>
    <p>These quantifiers are used with countable nouns (nouns that can be counted).</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>

              <h1>Gerund - Verb as a Noun</h1>
    
    <p>A gerund is a form of a verb that functions as a noun in a sentence. It is created by adding the suffix <strong>-ing</strong> to the base form of a verb. Although it originates from a verb, a gerund behaves like a noun and can occupy various roles in a sentence.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Run</strong> → <em>Running</em></li>
        <li><strong>Read</strong> → <em>Reading</em></li>
        <li><strong>Write</strong> → <em>Writing</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Uses of Gerunds</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>He is interested in <strong>studying</strong> abroad.</li>
        <li>They talked about <strong>going</strong> to the concert.</li>
        <li>She is good at <strong>drawing</strong> portraits.</li>

                <h1>Noun as Subject and Object Complement</h1>
    
    <p>In English grammar, a noun can serve different functions in a sentence. It can act as a subject complement or an object complement. Both roles are essential for providing more information about the subject or the object of the sentence.</p>
    
    <h2>Noun as Subject Complement</h2>
    <p>A subject complement is a noun or an adjective that follows a linking verb and provides more information about the subject of the sentence. It essentially renames or describes the subject.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>She is a teacher.</strong>
            <p><em>"Teacher"</em> is a noun that renames the subject <em>"She"</em>. The linking verb here is <em>"is"</em>.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Noun as Object Complement</h2>
    <p>An object complement is a noun or an adjective that follows and modifies or refers to the direct object of the sentence. It provides more information about the object and is usually used with certain verbs that take an object complement.</p>
    
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>They elected him president.</strong>
            <p><em>"President"</em> is a noun that describes the object <em>"him"</em>. The verb <em>"elected"</em> is followed by an object complement.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>She named her cat Max.</strong>
            <p><em>"Max"</em> is a noun that renames the object <em>"her cat"</em>. The verb <em>"named"</em> is followed by an object complement.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The committee found the proposal unacceptable.</strong>
            <p><em>"Unacceptable"</em> is an adjective acting as an object complement that describes the object <em>"the proposal"</em>. The verb <em>"found"</em> is followed by an object complement.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
