          <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
          <p>Hello! My name is Tom. I am 12 years old, and I want to tell you about my favorite hobby, which is playing basketball.</p>
          <p>I started playing basketball when I was 8 years old. My dad taught me how to play. He loves basketball too, and he used to play when he was younger. We have a basketball hoop in our backyard, and we play together almost every day.</p>
          <p>Basketball is a very fun and exciting sport. It is a game played between two teams. Each team has five players on the court. The main goal is to score points by throwing the ball through the opponent's hoop. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
          <p>I play basketball at school with my friends. We have a basketball team, and I am the captain. We practice three times a week after school. Our coach, Mr. Johnson, is very good. He teaches us new skills and helps us improve our game. We do a lot of drills and practice shooting, dribbling, and passing. We also play practice games to prepare for our matches.</p>
          <p>Playing basketball is not only fun, but it is also very good for you. It helps you stay fit and healthy. Running up and down the court is a great way to get exercise. It also helps improve your coordination and balance. Playing on a team teaches you how to work with others and communicate well.</p>
          <p>I also like to watch basketball games on TV. My favorite team is the Los Angeles Lakers. They have many great players. My favorite player is LeBron James. He is very talented and has won many awards. I like to watch his games and learn from his moves. I hope to be as good as him one day.</p>
          <p>In addition to playing at school, I also play in a local league. We have games every Saturday. Our team is called the Tigers. We wear orange and black jerseys. Last season, we won the championship. It was very exciting. We got a big trophy, and everyone was very happy.</p>
          <p>When I am not playing basketball, I like to read about it. I have many books and magazines about basketball. I also watch videos online to learn new techniques and tricks. I practice these new skills in my backyard. My dad helps me and gives me tips on how to improve.</p>
          <p>Sometimes, my friends come over to play basketball with me. We have a lot of fun. We play games and sometimes we have competitions to see who can make the most shots. We also practice our skills and help each other get better.</p>
          <p>Basketball has taught me many important lessons. It has taught me the value of hard work and dedication. To be good at basketball, you have to practice a lot. It is not always easy, but it is worth it. It has also taught me how to handle winning and losing. Winning is great, but losing is also a part of the game. It is important to learn from your mistakes and try to do better next time.</p>
          <p>I love playing basketball and I hope to continue playing for many years. My dream is to play in the NBA one day. I know it will take a lot of hard work, but I am ready for the challenge. Basketball is my passion, and it makes me very happy.</p>
          <p>I encourage everyone to find a hobby that they love. It is a great way to have fun and learn new things. Whether it is playing a sport, painting, or playing an instrument, having a hobby is very important. It helps you relax and enjoy life.</p>
          <p>Thank you for reading about my favorite hobby. I hope you enjoyed it. Maybe you can try playing basketball too. It is a lot of fun and a great way to stay healthy and active.</p>
